                <p>Hi! My name is Erin and this all about me! I was born in Switzerland but was raised in Flordia. I'm
                an only child. I like to tell people that my parents stopped once they had the perfect child. My favorite
                color is pink and aspire to be like Elle Woods from Legally Blonde.</p>

                <h3>Career</h3>

                <h4>Professional Duck Racer</h4>
                <h5>2007-Present</h5>
                <p>Since I was a little kid I loved ducks and have been professionally racing them for about 15 years. I've
                won national and international competitions and have been awarded the title Grand Quack Master. </p>

                <h4>Real Estate Agent</h4>
                <h5>2020-2022</h5>
                <p>Due to the pandemic duck competitions were put on hold so I got my real estate liscense and have
                been selling homes for the last couple of years.</p>

            <div class="hobbiesSection">
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>I spend most my days taking care of my ducks but when I do have free time I enjoy watching tv, reading books,
                online shopping, posting pics of my ducks, and traveling. The ducks don't really like to travel so I often leave them behind
                well all except for Senor Quack. He likes traveling but it gets pricey as he only flies first glass and needs his own seat.</p>
